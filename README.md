This database system was a group project we built to manage inventory for a computer retail business. It tracks the products, suppliers, stock levels, and sales in one organized place 
making it easy to see what's selling, what's running low, and which suppliers to contact when we need to restock. 
We added features like automatically updating inventory when items sell, flagging products that need reordering, and calculating total revenue per product, 
which saves time and prevents mistakes compared to manual tracking.

Working together, we designed the database to the best of our ability. We may have encountered some issues and the UI doesnt fully connect to the backend but we managed to push through.
The system prevents overselling by checking stock levels before recording sales, automatically logs when new inventory arrives, and generates useful reports and 
all things that would be tedious to do by hand. For the dbconnect.php file, We used the langauge php to try and connect the frontend to the backend and 
 the file was to show if the databse was connected or not and it had some issues we were unable to recolve. However for the index file, It has a login page 
  in which if it the correct username and password was entered, it would say that the login was succesful. Through this project, we learned how to turn real business needs into functional
database solutions while collaborating as a team to solve problems and implement features.
